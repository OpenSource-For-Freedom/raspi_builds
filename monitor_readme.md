# Automotive Computer System Monitoring Framework

## Overview
This Python framework enables the monitoring of automotive-based computer systems, particularly for PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) and electronic systems. It is designed for deployment on a Raspberry Pi using GPIO for input/output handling.

## Dependencies
- [gpiozero](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): GPIO library for Raspberry Pi
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Data visualization library

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install gpiozero matplotlib

Usage

	1.	Connect your PID or electronic system to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
	2.	Modify the monitor.py script to match your specific system and requirements. You may need to adjust pin numbers, sleep time, and implement PID control logic.
	3.	Execute the script:

python monitor.py

	4.	The monitoring loop will run for a specified duration, collecting input and output data. The results will be plotted using matplotlib.

Script Customization

Modify the following parameters in monitor.py:

	•	input_pin: GPIO pin connected to the input of the automotive system.
	•	output_pin: GPIO pin connected to the output of the automotive system.
	•	duration_sec: Duration of the monitoring loop in seconds.

Additional Notes

	•	Adjust sleep time in the monitoring loop based on the system’s response time.
	•	Customize the plot_data function for advanced data visualization if needed.
